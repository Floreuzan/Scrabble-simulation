For a small n, we observe a discrete distribution. It tends to be a Bernoulli distribution because it only has two answers (two columns).

However, for n large, the plot shows a bell shape with a skew greater than 0. With n large, it is asymptotically normally distributed according to the Central Limit Theorem.
